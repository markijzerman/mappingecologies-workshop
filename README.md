## Planning
###DAY 1: Introductions

- What are hyperlocal ecology-questions?

- A look at what are we going to do:
	- Measure ourselves. Record audio/video/data ourselves.
	- photography, virtual photography- virtual narrative.
	- live sonification or visualisation. 3d reconstruction. photogrammetry.
	- tools: whatever you're comfortable to use with help to guide you through you're wanting to use (Touchdesigner, MAX/Puredata, Metashape/Meshroom, Ableton, some Python, Google Colab, Qgis ...)
	- "Homework": Record and bring some materials to work with next time.


###DAY 2: Data & Narrative
- Round of everyones ideas on a project.
- What is your narrative? What is your data? How can the two come together?

- Small mini-workshops in:
	- Working with geospatial information and satellite imagery (Qgis and TouchDesigner)
	- Data collection, visualisation & sonification (Arduino, Max & Touchdesigner)
	- Photogrammetry (Metashape, Meshroom)

###DAY 3: Work-specific help
- How is everyone doing?
- Working, help & peer-to-peer helping
